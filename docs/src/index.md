# Jube

Jube

Is Polarized emission modelling framework for theoretical studies of image morphology of blackhole accretion flow. 
In its current version, Jube allows for the definition of various axi-symmetric emission models in the Kerr spacetime, but has been designed with scalability in mind to incorporate other types of emission models and spacetimes in the future.

## Requirements

The minimum Julia version we require is 1.6, which is the current LTS release. In the future we may increase this as Julia advances.
